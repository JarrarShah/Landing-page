                <p class="text-dark text-2xl">At the core of the spraying system is a dish-shaped rotating stainless
                    steel disc.
                    The disc is rotated at speed; whereupon liquids are fed into the centre of the spinning disc. As
                    this liquid is accelerated by the spinning disc, it spirals out to the edge of the disc and is then
                    launched tangentially into the air. Here, the disc will spray uniformly and homogeneously through a
                    full 360 degrees.
                    By enclosing the spinning disc with a metal cover incorporating an adjustable aperture; a precision
                    spray pattern can be focused on the required area of application.

                    The feed tube to the spinning disc has an aperture of between 6.0 to 9.5mm (dependent upon model).
                    This allows liquids of varying densities, including scurries with particulates in suspension, to be
                    sprayed with the same precision and uniformity of deposition: without fear of blockages or
                    variations in the spray strength. For thorough system cleaning, we have ensured that the key parts
                    disassemble very easily.</p>

                    For a more effective application of spray liquid in a top only mode; two contra-rotating disc heads
                    are used. The discs are grouped closely* together to provide a consistent, uniform spray directly
                    over the product. A balanced stainless steel manifold ensures that the pump output is evenly
                    distributed to each spray head. Spray material that is not deposited on the product is collected
                    under the conveyor and channeled back to the reservoir. When used for spraying meat pies in foil
                    bases, for example; this configuration helps protect the foil from being sprayed.</br></br>

                    In certain applications, this can be very effective in providing a simple two-dimensional or "Top
                    Only" spraying system. For "Top &amp; Sides" coverage, a single disc is not sufficient. Note: The
                    disc is inclined to improve the quality of the spray and to channel unused spray material back to
                    the reservoir. </br></br> In Top &amp; Sides spraying, it is important to ensure that the spray
                    pattern covers evenly and with precision the key surfaces:</p>

                </ul>

                <p class=" text-2xl">To create a spray pattern for "Top &amp; Sides," we use a pair of contra-rotating
                    discs. The spray
                    patterns of each disc in this configuration merge with the other to provide an even homogeneous
                    precision coverage of spray material across the full width of the system. The discs are arranged in
                    a "V" shape so that the front and rear of the product can be sprayed. A balanced stainless steel
                    manifold ensures that the pump output is evenly distributed to each spray head. Spray material that
                    is not deposited on the product is collected under the conveyor and channeled back to the reservoir.

                    </br></br>The effectiveness of the "Top &amp; Sides" coverage is also dependent upon the shape or
                    profile of the product itself, as well as on the potential masking of the spray by adjacent products
                    on the conveyor system. In such circumstances, we may use multiple spinning discs ganged together as
                    contra-rotating pairs. This provides the flexibility to create a configuration for consistent and
                    uniform spray across the spray bed.</br></br>

                </h3>

                <p class="text-dark text-2xl">Not all food spraying can be accomplished at ambient temperature; some
                    applications require that the spraying material is heated or chilled to a temperature other than
                    that of its surroundings. There are typically three reasons why temperature is varied at the point
                    of spray application.</p><br><br>

                <h5 class="font-bold text-slate-800 text-2xl md:text-4xl">SAFETY</h5>

                <p class="text-dark text-2xl">Certain spray materials such as real egg glaze/egg wash require constant
                    chilling to stop the growth of bacteria within the spray medium. The EU's directive on spraying of
                    real egg glaze requires the medium to be maintained at a temperature of between 4-6 degrees
                    centigrade. Chilled egg glaze has a longer active production life than non-chilled.</p><br><br>

                <h5 class="font-bold text-2xl md:text-4xl text-slate-800">EFFECTIVENESS</h5>

                <p class="text-dark text-2xl">Typically, the spray medium is easier to apply when the temperature is
                    raised since the medium is less viscous and can be applied thinly.</p><br><br>

                <h5 class="font-bold text-2xl md:text-4xl text-slate-800">AVAILABILITY</h5>

                <p class="text-dark text-2xl">When spraying a supersaturated solution that cannot exist at ambient
                    temperature, for example when spraying a high-value Brix sugar syrup solution. Here, the
                    supersaturated solution could only exist in solution at temperatures above ambient.</p><br><br>

                <h5 class="font-bold text-2xl md:text-4xl text-slate-800">METHODOLOGY</h5>

                <p class="text-dark text-2xl">Saturn Spraying augments its standard DiscMaster™ and DiscMatic™ design
                    with double-skinned capillary-tracked radiating surfaces on its in-feed and out-feed drip trays, as
                    well as the system reservoir since these surfaces are in close contact with the spraying liquid. An
                    external temperature control pack pumps food-safe coolant through the closed loop system allowing
                    close regulation of the temperature. The system temperature control pack is rated to be able to
                    easily maintain the spray material at the desired temperature.</p><br><br>
