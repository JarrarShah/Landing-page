        </div>
        <p class="text-dark">At the core of the spraying system is a dish-shaped rotating stainless steel disc.
          The disc is rotated at speed; whereupon liquids are fed into the centre of the spinning disc. As
          this liquid is accelerated by the spinning disc, it spirals out to the edge of the disc and is then
          launched tangentially into the air. Here, the disc will spray uniformly and homogeneously through a
          full 360 degrees.
          By enclosing the spinning disc with a metal cover incorporating an adjustable aperture; a precision
          spray pattern can be focused on the required area of application.
  
          The feed tube to the spinning disc has an aperture of between 6.0 to 9.5mm (dependent upon model).
          This allows liquids of varying densities, including scurries with particulates in suspension, to be
          sprayed with the same precision and uniformity of deposition: without fear of blockages or
          variations in the spray strength. For thorough system cleaning, we have ensured that the key parts
          disassemble very easily.</p>

          With Spinning Disc Spraying, the glaze is applied to either the 'top only' or 'top & sides' surfaces, depending
          on the needs of the product. The combination of the number of discs pairs, their geometric position, and the
          system's various speed settings give the desired precision spray coverage. Saturn Spraying System's DiscMaster™
          and DiscMatic™ series of machines are designed to provide high-performance egg glazing capabilities.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The egg glaze itself can be real or synthetic and applied at either ambient or chilled temperatures. EU
          recommendation stresses the importance of maintaining real egg at a temperature of between 4 ­to 6°C. Saturn
          provides the facility to temperature regulate the spray material during application. The advantage of our design
          is that the spray material is being continuously pumped around the machine and returned to the system reservoir,
          which brings the spray material into contact with the refrigerated surfaces of the machine, maintaining the
          temperature of the egg glaze more accurately.

          Egg Glazing </h5>
        <p>Food Production requires the spraying of oil onto the food surface for the following reasons:</p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl mt-5 mb-5 font-bold">Barrier Coat:</h3>
        <p>
          Oils such as Palm Oil are sprayed over the outside of the product. The coating reduces the uptake of moisture in
          the next manufacturing stage. Since viscosity is inversely proportional to temperature for all materials, the
          palm oil (which is a solid at room temperature) is heated to the point where the viscosity is optimum for
          precision spraying.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl mt-5 mb-5 font-bold">Provide Lubrication:</h3>
  
        <p>
          Oil acts as a lubricant between the layers of pastry in products like Filo Pastry, where dough oiling ensures an
          excellent product.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl mt-5 mb-5 font-bold">Crisping Agent:</h3>
  
        <p>
          Oil is sprayed onto the outside of the product to improve product texture in the next stage of the cooking
          process. For example, French Fries &amp; Roast Potatoes.

        Dough Oiling
      </h5>
      <p>Dough Oiling is simply the process of providing a light film of oil to the outer surface of kneaded dough,
        including dough balls and pizza bases. One of the most popular oiling processes is the preparation of Filo
        {Phyllo, Fillo} pastry for pie lines. Oil can be applied to either a single side or both sides of the continuous
        pastry line, providing lubrication as it is folded and layered.</p>
      </br>
      <p>The process requires that the applicator should:</p>
      </br>
      <ul class="p-6 text-2xl grow text-left font-bold" style="color: #FE590F;">
        <li>Apply oil homogeneously across the FILO pastry</li></br>
        <li>Cover both sides of the pastry (if required)</li></br>
        <li>Precision regulation of the oil coverage</li></br>
        <li>Accommodate relatively high-speed line application</li></br>
      </ul>
      </br>
      <p>Saturn’s DiscMaster™ and DiscMatic™ Series of Spraying Systems provides the optimum oiling application systems,
        by utilizing the 2D Top & Bottom system configuration.</p>

        Bread Preservatives
      </h5>
      <p>
        For leavened bread products, particularly in warmer environments, a mixture of Potassium Sorbate and other mould
        inhibitors are applied to the external surfaces of the bread to increases the shelf life. By inhibiting the growth
        of mould, the shelf life can be significantly extended without compromising either the taste or the cosmetic
        appearance of the bread. The Potassium Sorbate needs to be applied with an evenness and precision to ensure that
        the loaf is completely coated.
        </br></br>
        Preservatives are precision sprayed onto the bread, as one of the last manufacturing processes the bread is
        subjected to after it exits the oven. Here it is important to ensure that adjacent products do not mask or inhibit
        the application of the Potassium Sorbate spray. Divergent conveyor belts or spreaders are used to increase the gap
        between the loaves until full spray coverage can be completed. A converging conveyor is often used to return the
        loaves to their previous belt configuration.
        </br></br>
        The picture shows loaves too close for spraying. These would need to pass through a divergent conveyor unit which
        will increase the spacing between the loaves to prevent product masking of the spray.

        <p>Saturn’s DiscMaster™ and DiscMatic™ Spinning Disc Spraying Systems both equally lend themselves to this

          bread production invariably requires the belt widths available only with the DiscMatic™ system.

        <p class="text-dark">Oil & Salt coating of Biscuits and Snacks is easily accomplished with Saturn’s DiscMatic™
          Slurry System. As with the application of flavors, spices and seasoning, a base layer of oil provides the medium

        <p class="text-dark">
          Granular products such as sugars, nuts, dried herbs, breadcrumbs and various seeds, such as poppy, sesame and
          cracked wheat, can be sprinkled with even precision on to the top of produce using Saturn's Sprinkler. The
          sprinkler head is mounted over its own integral conveyor.
          </br></br>
          The sprinkler uses an interchangeable, grooved roller which is driven by an inverter controlled, electric motor.
          The roller is mounted on the bottom of a hopper, into which the granular material to be sprinkled is placed. As
          the roller rotates, granular products in the hopper, are gravity fed to engage with the grooved roller. The
          grooves picks up granuals and rotates through 180 degrees. The granular products are now free to drop by gravity
          onto the products directly underneath the roller.
          </br></br>
          The application rate is regulated by adjusting the speed of rotation of the roller, using the digital
          potentiometer in the control cabinet. The grooves in the roller are machined to accept the granular size of the
          product being sprinkled. Where different granular sizes of products are to be used, interchangeable application
          rollers may be required for each product.

          Extending the Shelf Life of Fruit and Vegetables.
        </h5>
        <p>
          Food safety is vitally important to the food processing industry since all food items are extremely vulnerable
          to contamination. The uncontrolled growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and protozoa, results in
          food spoilage, which reduces both the shelf life and yield of the product. The Food industry always faces a
          challenging situation in the minimising of microbial contamination, giving the customer the very best product
          they can buy, whilst protecting their narrow profit margins in a highly competitive market.
          </br></br>
          However, with the investment and effort made in producing quality products, it makes sense to take the
          appropriate steps to protect the product. Contamination can happen at any time during harvesting, processing,
          storage or transportation. For many years, the traditional treatment of many fresh fruit and vegetable products
          was to wash them in either a ‘bath’ or flume, with a liquid sterilant, e.g., chlorinated water. Unfortunately,
          the processes themselves result in damage or ‘bruising’ to the product. This reduces yield and increases the
          cost of getting fruits to market.
          </br></br>
          Saturn’s <span class="font-bold" style="color: #FE590F;">DiscMaster™</span> and <span class="font-bold"
            style="color: #FE590F;">DiscMatic™</span> Spraying Systems have proven extremely adept at solving the issues
          of
          applying a very fine precision spray of sterilant to the products, as they pass through the machine, whilst
          ensuring that product handling problems are minimised. The ‘all over’ sterilant spray capability has proved
          particularly successful in the processing of berry fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries,
          grapes, blueberries, blackcurrants and redcurrants. Peppers, tomatoes, carrots, and even ‘Portobello’ mushrooms
          have benefited from the treatment, where the application of an organic sterilant has successfully been shown to
          extend the shelf life of these products. Notwithstanding the benefits to the supplier and the consumer, in
          knowing products are ‘safe for consumption’.
          </br></br>
          Such has been the success of this development that many suppliers of fruit and vegetable products to the major
          supermarket chains have installed the Saturn Spraying Systems’ machines in their production lines.

          Introduction
        </h5>
        <p>
          Fried foods are popular due to their taste, distinctive flavour, aroma and crunchy texture, which results from
          an important and versatile cooking process that has been around since antiquity. Modern manufacturing also likes
          the Deep Fat Frying (DFF), since not only does it make a unique contribution to the smell and taste of the food,
          but the relatively low cost of large-scale frying, has made fried foods the staple of the ever growing late
          20th-century fast food industry. The downside, however, is that the high content of saturated fats associated
          with DFF is considered a major factor in increasing health risks such as coronary heart disease, cancer,
          diabetes and hypertension. A large proportion of the total fat consumed in modern society is through fried
          foods.
          </br></br>
          Scientists and Food Technologists have worked hard to understand the principles of DFF in order to reduce the
          uptake of fat which occurs within the process. Currently, there are two processes that have achieved commercial
          results, the first is the application of a Barrier Emulsion which blocks the take-up of fat during the frying
          process; the second creates a product with the appearance of a DFF product but achieves this by using oven
          baking, resulting in all the enjoyment of fried food without the guilt.
          </br></br>
          Saturn has worked closely with Food Scientists from some of the top European Food Technology Centres to support
          the development of these processes. We were approached because Saturn’s Spinning Disc Technology demonstrably
          met the demanding criteria necessary for the successful application. Saturn’s DiscMaster™ and DiscMatic™
          products have shown that precision all over spraying with controlled deposition is crucial to achieving
          consistently high-quality low-fat products.

          Barrier Emulsions
        </h5>
        <p>
          By applying a barrier emulsion to the food product prior to the deep fat frying process, the emulsion blocks the rapid take-up of oil during the initial phases of the cooking process. Careful control of the application process can ensure the finished product will be classified as low fat. Recent formulations make it impossible to discern a difference in the presentation and taste of the finished product. Control of the barrier application is a key part in the successful outcome of the process.

          The Low Fat Chip and Roast Potatoes
        </h5>
        <p>
          The humble potato is sometimes considered as the mainstay of western cuisine. Served roasted, chipped, sautéed, scalloped or just plain mashed, the versatile potato has always been popular. However, in the last few decades, it is perhaps fitting that the two more unhealthy versions the potato, the ‘chip’ and the ‘roasted’ potato have undergone a healthy makeover. Modern production techniques have been applied to provide us with the oven cooked low-fat chip and the low-fat roasted potato, all the flavour with only a little of the guilt.
        </br></br>
          Without completely demystifying an elaborate and carefully controlled production process, the essential aim of the ‘low-fat’ potato product, is to carefully control the type and amount of oil take-up in the cooking process. By pre-covering the potato with exactly the correct amount of oil coverage by weight, the final oven cooked product will be perfect every time.
        </br></br>
          By applying a ‘3D all over spray’ of oil to a mono-layer of the potato product, Saturn Spraying’s DiscMaster™ and DiscMatic™ are up to the task of applying the precision control to the spray process. Without this control, it would be impossible to claim the ‘low-fat’ accolade so necessary for this process.
