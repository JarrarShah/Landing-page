Details_1: "The system can be configured for Top, Top & Sides or All Over Spray Coverage by the number and positioning of the Spinning Discs. All the discs operate in ganged pairs and are belt driven from inverter-motor sets. Operationally, the DiscMatic™ offers highly repeatable precision in the application of spray material. Precision Inverter/Motor Control Systems provide digital verneer control to the Spinning Disc Speed, Pump Speed and the Conveyor Speed allowing full control over the droplet formation and deposition of the spray material. Recording the setting of the digital potentiometer for each of the key control systems provides a unique digital signature for each machine set-up. Product changeovers can be quickly accommodated by entering the signature code into the machine for the appropriate machine configuration. The precision accuracy inherent in the system ensures it correctly returns to an identical set up as the last batch of that particular product. A proportion of the pump output is returned directly to the reservoir tank, which provides:"

System_Construcion: "Built as a single integral unit with removable access panels and stainless steel pipe work, the DiscMaster™ is designed for ease of cleaning and maintenance. When configured for both top and bottom spraying there will be a minimum working height for the conveyor belt. The Standard Disc Motor supplied is an IP66 Stainless Steel which provides a high level of water protection with an excellent cosmetic finish. It allows for easy cleaning as well as ease of maintenance

The width of the machine can be selected to suit either the application or the existing conveyor belt width. The machine series can accommodate line widths up to 700 mm. The maximum number of spray heads on the top is four with two spray heads fitted underneath.

The standard length of the machine is 1000 mm, but the in-feed and out-feed can be extended as required to meet system installation requirements {see 'Extended Conveyor' section below}. Conveyor belts can be either stainless steel wire enrobing for loose product or chain drive for trays. The maximum belt width available with the DiscMaster™ series is 700 mm."
System_Materials: The machine is constructed in stainless steel grade 304, with pipework in 316-grade steel. All components in direct contact with the material being sprayed and the product are stainless steel or other food quality materials. The design ensures all areas of the machine are fully accessible for cleaning and every effort is made to ensure that the hygiene aspects of the machine are to the highest possible standard.
System_Electrical_Requirements: "The system requires a ‘Clean’ Three Phase Supply.
UK Power requirements are :-      415V 3Ph 50Hz + Neutral + Earth."
